/* The goal of this exercise is to apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element, while leaving elements that *aren't* descendants of that element unstyled.

The properties you need to add are:

* Only the `p` elements that are descendants of the `div` element should have a yellow background, red text, a font size of 20px, and center aligned.*/

div .text {
    background-color: rgb(251, 255, 0);
    color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
    font-size: 20px;
