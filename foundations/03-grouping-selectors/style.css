/*Instead of having a single element with two different rules applied, though, you're instead going to give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. Make sure you take a good look at the outcome image below to see exactly what is unique about each element, and what both elements have in common.

* **The first element**: a black background and white text
* **The second element**: a yellow background
* **Both elements**: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback*/
